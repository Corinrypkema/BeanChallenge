Ideas
-----
1.  Our house has a liquid heat solar panel system that has a pretty dumb monitoring system. Right now we collect important temperature data by hand, and change our use habits around said data.  My mom likes the idea automating this process and would buy a couple of beans if it works well.  

2. A remote washing machine monitoring system.  I have a GPRS Arduino shield that could send alerts as to the current estimated status of a washing machine.  Currently a big problem in my house at WPI is the timely removal of cleaned clothes.  I was concerned that the iPad wouldn't be able to compile the GSM library, but it seems like it is included on the cloud compiler library list: http://beantalk.punchthrough.com/t/cloud-compiler-library-requests/1101


3. A wearable driver alertness monitor.  Its pretty easy to get tired while driving a cold car at night (or too warm), and thus enter a dangerous semi-awake state.  The monitor would provide a real time indication for head/body movement, heat in the vehicle, ambient light and if hands are placed in the correct position on the wheels.


Roadmap
--------
*~~Connect bean to iPad~~
*~~Play with the various sensors in the package~~
*~~Come up with ideas~~
*~~Select idea~~
*~~Hello World on i2c OLED~~
* Display temperature on the OLED
* use external thermistor on analog in
* log data to SD card
* SD card viewer application
  *choose backend
* design and fab SD card interface for the bean
